I recently conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an organization's database, employing a variety of techniques from basic querying to advanced methods like joins, window functions, and sub-queries. This allowed me to extract valuable insights, identify patterns, and uncover relationships within the data. My approach enabled a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, providing a solid foundation for informed decision-making and actionable recommendations.
